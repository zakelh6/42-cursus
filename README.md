## üó£Ô∏è About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that offers a new way of learning technology:
	no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer
	learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is
	free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the so-called "Piscine" - becoming
	thus "cadets" (42's students).

\* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine repo](https://github.com/zakelh6/42Piscine-C).

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.
